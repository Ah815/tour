    <p>Tourism in Pakistan is a growing industry.[1] In 2010, Lonely Planet termed Pakistan "tourism's 'next big thing' for more years than we care to remember". The country is geographically and ethnically diverse, and has a number of historical and cultural heritage sites. Condé Nast Traveller ranked Pakistan The Best Holiday Destination for 2020[2] and also declared it the third-highest potential adventure destination in the world for 2020.[2] As security in the country improves, tourism increases; in two years, it has increased by more than 300%.[3] The Pakistani government had launched online visa services for 175 countries[4] and 50 countries were offered visa on arrival,[5] making a visit to Pakistan easier. The country received an influx of travel vloggers, who promoted the characteristics of the country, such as in the Northern Pakistan, like Hunza and Skardu.[6]

        In 2018, the British Backpacker Society ranked Pakistan the world's top adventure travel destination, describing the country as "one of the friendliest countries on earth, with mountain scenery that is beyond anyone's wildest imagination".[7] Forbes ranked Pakistan as one of the ‘coolest places’ to visit in 2019.[8] The World Economic Forum's Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report placed Pakistan in the top 25 per cent of global destinations for its World Heritage sites, which range from the mangroves in the Indus delta to the Indus Valley civilization sites including Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.[9]</p>
