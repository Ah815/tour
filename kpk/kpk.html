        Islamabad Capital Territory to the east, Autonomous Territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir to the north-east. It
        shares an international border with Afghanistan to the west. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is known as a tourist hot spot
        for adventurers and explorers and has a varied landscape ranging from rugged mountain ranges, valleys, plains
        surrounded by hills, undulating submontane areas and dense agricultural farms.
