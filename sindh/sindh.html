    <P>Sindh (/ˈsɪnd/; Sindhi: سنڌ; Urdu: سندھ, pronounced [sɪndʱ]; historically romanized as Sind) is one of
        the four provinces of Pakistan. Located in the southeastern region of the country, Sindh is the third-largest
        province of Pakistan by land area and the second-largest province by population after Punjab. It shares land
        borders with the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan to the east and north-east and Punjab to the north.
        It shares International border with the Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan to the east; it is also
        bounded by the Arabian Sea to the south. Sindh's landscape consists mostly of alluvial plains flanking
        the Indus River, the Thar Desert in the eastern portion of the province along the international border
        with India, and the Kirthar Mountains in the western portion of the province.
        The economy of Sindh is the second-largest in Pakistan after the province of Punjab; its provincial capital
        of Karachi is the most populous city in the country as well as its main financial hub. Sindh is home to a large
        portion of Pakistan's industrial sector and contains two of the country's busiest commercial seaports: Port
        Qasim and the Port of Karachi. The remainder of Sindh consists of an agriculture-based economy and produces
        fruits, consumer items and vegetables for other parts of the country.
